So, his total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the increased value of the house.\nThe repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. The original value of the house was $80,000. A 150% increase means the value increased by 150% of $80,000, which is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. So, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\n## 3: Calculate the profit made by Josh.\nThe profit made is the difference between the new value of the house and Josh's total investment. So, the profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\nThe final answer is: $70,000"

So, the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total amount of money John spent on video games.\nJohn bought 8 video games for $20 each. So, the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.\n\n## 3: Determine the total amount of money John had before buying the video games and the amount left.\nJohn had $195 and spent $160 on video games, and then he had $5 left. This confirms that he spent $160 and had $5 left, which matches the given information.\n\n## 4: Since John used all his money from selling toys to buy video games and had $5 left, we need to figure out how many Lego sets he still has.\nGiven that he sold 13 Lego sets to get $195, and he used this money to buy video games and had $5 left, it implies he didn't sell all his Lego sets. Let's assume he still has x Lego sets.\n\n## 5: Calculate how much money John would have if he hadn't sold any Lego sets and then sold some.\nHowever, from the information given, we understand that he sold 13 sets to get $195. The fact that he had $5 left after spending $160 on video games implies that $195 - $160 = $35 was the amount he didn't get from selling all his sets, or alternatively, he didn't spend it.\n\n## 6: Understand that $35 represents the value of the Lego sets he didn't sell.\nEach Lego set sells for $15. So, the number of Lego sets he didn't sell (and thus still has) is $35 / $15.\n\n## 7: Calculate the number of Lego sets John still has.\nThe number of Lego sets John still has is $35 / $15 = 2.333. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a Lego set, and assuming the calculation approach was right but ensuring we're using it to find how many sets he didn't sell: if $35 represents the value of unsold sets and each set is $15, then 35 / 15 gives 2.333. This implies a miscalculation in using $35 directly as leftover from not selling; correctly, $5 leftover means he effectively used $190.\n\n## 8: Recalculate based on correct understanding.\nIf John got $195 and spent $160, leaving him with $5, then he effectively spent $190 on video games. This $190 comes from selling some of his Lego sets. He originally had 13 sets. Let's denote the number of sets he sold as 13 - x.\n\n## 9: Formulate equation.\nThe money from selling (13 - x) sets at $15 each equals $190: (13 - x) * 15 = 190.\n\n## 10: Solve for x.\nSolving (13 - x) * 15 = 190:\n13 * 15 - 15x = 190,\n195 - 15x = 190,\n-15x = -5,\nx = 5 / 15,\nx = 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"

            "## Step 1: Calculate the number of blue ties John bought.\nFirst, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties and each blue tie costs $40. So, the number of blue ties = total spent on blue ties / cost per blue tie = 200 / 40 = 5.\n\n## 2: Determine the number of red ties John bought.\nJohn buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he bought 5 blue ties, the number of red ties = 2 * number of blue ties = 2 * 5 = 10.\n\n## 3: Calculate the cost of one red tie.\nThe red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, and 50% of $40 is $20, each red tie costs $40 + $20 = $60.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total amount spent on red ties.\nNow, we calculate the total spent on red ties. Since John bought 10 red ties at $60 each, the total spent on red ties = number of red ties * cost per red tie = 10 * 60 = $600.\n\n## 5: Calculate the total amount spent on ties.\nTo find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties. Total spent = $200 (on blue ties) + $600 (on red ties) = $800.\n\nThe final answer is: $800"

This can be done by dividing the distance she has traveled since the last fill-up by the amount of gas she needed to refill her tank. distance_traveled = 100 miles, gas_refilled = 4 gallons.\n\n## 2: Calculate the miles per gallon (mpg).\nmpg = distance_traveled / gas_refilled = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.\n\n## 3: Calculate how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.\nNow that we know Sophia's car achieves 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how far she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total capacity of her gas tank. tank_capacity = 12 gallons.\n\n## 4: Perform the calculation for total distance.\ntotal_distance = mpg * tank_capacity = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{300}$"

So, her initial annual salary is $600 * 12 = $7200.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the increase in salary\nThe company increases the salaries of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed in the company for five years. The initial salary is $7200, and 10% of $7200 is 0.10 * $7200 = $720.\n\n## 3: Calculate Sylvie's salary after three more years of service\nSince Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, the salary increase will apply for the next three years. We need to add $720 to her current annual salary for each of the next three years. However, we must note that the increase is based on the initial salary, not the current salary. So, her salary for the next three years will be $7200 + $720 = $7920 each year.\n\n## 4: Confirm the salary for the specified period\nThe increase is a one-time event for those who have completed five years, and then the salary remains constant at the increased rate for those still employed. However, given the problem statement, it seems the increase applies annually after the 5-year mark for those who stay. But specifically, it mentions an increase of 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed for five years, which could imply a misunderstanding. Given standard interpretations, a 10% increase on initial salary ($7200) would indeed be $720 added annually after the 5-year mark for eligible employees. So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years, assuming she stays, would still be $7920, as the increase applies to her base salary calculation once, then her salary remains at that new level.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7920}$"

If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.\n\n## 2: Find out how many birds are in Jamal's photograph based on Brittany's phone capacity.\nThe maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, this means 300 is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of birds (ducks) in Jamal's photograph.\nTo find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph, we divide the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50. So, 300 / 50 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"

Sasha has 5 boards, so the total original cost for these boards is 5 boards * $16/board = $80.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total original cost of all the boards.\nThe total original cost for all the boards is $100 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180.\n\n## 4: Determine the selling price of each type of board after the 50% price increase.\nThe price of lumber has gone up by 50%. Therefore, the new price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 * 1.5 = $15, and for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 * 1.5 = $24.\n\n## 5: Calculate the total selling price of all the boards.\nSasha has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, which she sells for $15 each, so she gets 10 * $15 = $150. She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, which she sells for $24 each, so she gets 5 * $24 = $120. The total selling price for all boards is $150 + $120 = $270.\n\n## 6: Calculate the profit Sasha makes.\nThe profit Sasha makes is the total selling price minus the total original cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$"

Since their speeds are given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances from miles to feet. 1 mile = 5280 feet. Therefore, Steve lives 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet from school, and Tim lives 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet from school.\n\n## 2: Calculate Steve's time to get home\nSteve's distance to home is 15840 feet, and his speed is 440 feet per minute. To find the time it takes for Steve to get home, we use the formula time = distance / speed. So, Steve's time = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.\n\n## 3: Calculate Tim's time to get home\nTim's distance to home is 10560 feet, and his speed is 264 feet per minute. Using the same formula, Tim's time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.\n\n## 4: Determine the winner and the waiting time\nSince Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The difference in their times is 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes. This means Steve will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"

To find the factor by which the price increases, we calculate 100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.20 times the previous price.\n\n## 4: Apply the price increases over 36 months.\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the increase is based on the original price, not the new price. So, every 2 months, we add 20% of the original price to the current price. The correct approach is to calculate the increase as a fixed amount added each period: 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4. This $4 is added every 2 months.\n\n## 5: Calculate the total increase in price over 36 months.\nThe price increases by $4 every 2 months. Over 36 months, there are 18 periods of 2 months. So, the total increase is 18 * $4 = $72.\n\n## 6: Calculate the final price after 36 months.\nThe original price is $20. Adding the total increase of $72 to the original price: $20 + $72 = $92.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{92}$"

There are 3 favorable outcomes. Since there are 6 possible outcomes in total, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.\n\n## 2: Determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.\nThe even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die rolls are independent events, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25.\n\n## 3: Calculate the difference in likelihood between the two events.\nTo find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. So, 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.\n\n## 4: Express the difference in likelihood as a percentage.\nTo express this difference as a percentage, we take the difference (0.25) and divide it by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row (0.25), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (0.25 / 0.25) * 100 = 100%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100}$"

So, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.\n\n## 5: Calculate how many times Sara must mow the lawn to earn enough money.\nEach time Sara mows the lawn, she earns $4. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide $40 by $4. So, $40 / $4 = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"

Since she is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, we add these together:\n   36 cookies (today) + 30 cookies (tomorrow) = 66 cookies\n\n2. Since a dozen cookies equals 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens 66 cookies is. We do this by dividing 66 by 12:\n   66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozen cookies\n\n3. We know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Since Carla is making 5.5 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozen cookies by the amount of flour needed per dozen:\n   5.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups of flour per dozen = 11 cups of flour\n\nTherefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. \n\nAnswer: 11 cups of flour."

So, the effective working time is 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.\n\n## 3: Determine how many 10-minute intervals are in the effective working time.\nSince Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes. This is calculated as 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total earnings.\nSusan earns $5 for every 10-minute interval. So, for 15 intervals, she earns 15 * $5 = $75.\n\nThe final answer is: $75"

Therefore, the weakness added by the cream is 15 milliliters.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total weakness of Shannon's iced coffee.\nTo find the total weakness of Shannon's iced coffee, we add the weakness from the ice cubes (60 milliliters) and the weakness from adding cream (15 milliliters). So, 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$"

So, the total income for Job A is 15 * 2000 = $30,000.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the net income for Job A after taxes\nNext, we need to calculate the net income for Job A after taxes. The total tax rate in the state for Job A is 20%. So, the taxes for Job A will be 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * 30,000 = $6,000. Therefore, the net income for Job A is 30,000 - 6,000 = $24,000.\n\n## 3: Calculate the net income for Job B after property tax\nJob B pays $42,000 a year and has a property tax of $6,000. So, the income after property tax for Job B is 42,000 - 6,000 = $36,000.\n\n## 4: Calculate the net income for Job B after income tax\nThe state for Job B charges a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. So, the income tax for Job B will be 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * 36,000 = $3,600. Therefore, the net income for Job B is 36,000 - 3,600 = $32,400.\n\n## 5: Compare the net incomes of Job A and Job B\nNow, let's compare the net incomes of Job A and Job B to find out which job has a higher net pay rate.

            "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.\n\n2. On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday. So, they sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.\n\n3. On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before. So, they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.\n\n4. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, we need to subtract 6 pairs from the total.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pairs sold:\n14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) = 56 pairs\n\nAfter subtracting the returned pairs:\n56 - 6 = 50 pairs\n\nSince each pair contains 2 shoes, we need to multiply the total pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes:\n50 * 2 = 100 shoes\n\nSo, by the end of the sale, the store sold 100 tennis shoes. \n\nThe final answer is: 100."

The formula to calculate simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest per year, and t is the time in years. Here, P = $3,650, r = 10% or 0.10, and t = 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).\n\n## 2: Apply the values to the interest formula\nI = 3650 * 0.10 * (5/12) = 3650 * 0.10 * 0.4167 = 3650 * 0.04167 = 152.04\n\n## 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid\nThe total amount Karan has to pay back is the principal amount plus the interest. Total amount = $3,650 + $152.04 = $3,802.04\n\n## 4: Calculate the monthly payment\nKaran has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months. To find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by the number of months. Monthly payment = Total amount / number of months = $3,802.04 / 5\n\n## 5: Perform the division\nMonthly payment = $3,802.04 / 5 = $760.408\n\n## 6: Round the monthly payment to two decimal places\nMonthly payment \u2248 $760.41\n\nThe final answer is: $760.41"

Let's convert everything into minutes because one of the activities is given in minutes. Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, she spends 4 * 60 = 240 minutes writing a song.\n\n## 2: Calculate the time spent recording the song\nCarol spends half the time she spent writing the song recording it. Since she spent 240 minutes writing the song, she spends 240 / 2 = 120 minutes recording it.\n\n## 3: Note the time spent editing the song\nCarol spends 90 minutes editing the song.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total time spent on the song\nThe total time Carol spent on the song is the sum of the time spent writing, recording, and editing. So, total time = 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.\n\n## 5: Calculate the percentage of time spent editing\nTo find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we take the time spent editing (90 minutes) and divide it by the total time spent on the song (450 minutes), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

            "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the number of sandwiches needed\nSince each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we divide the total number of people by the number of people one sandwich serves to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. \n20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed\nEach sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese. So, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:\n- 5 pounds of meat (5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich)\n- 5 pounds of cheese (5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich)\n\n## 3: Calculate the cost of the meat\nThe meat costs $7.00 per pound. For 5 pounds of meat:\n5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00\n\n## 4: Calculate the cost of the cheese\nThe cheese costs $3.00 per pound. For 5 pounds of cheese:\n5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00\n\n## 5: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese\nTo find the total cost, add the cost of the meat to the cost of the cheese:\n$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00\n\nThe final answer is: $50"

            "To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we first need to determine the elevation at which the comb is located after it fell.\n\nStanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet. The comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. So, the elevation of the comb is:\n\n10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet\n\nOliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb at 6,000 feet, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation of the comb:\n\n6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet\n\nTherefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. \n\nAnswer: 3,000."

The swim took 40 minutes, the bike ride took 1 hour and 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes), and the run took 50 minutes. So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.\n\n## 2: Calculate James's swim time\nJames finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Since Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, James took 10% less than 40 minutes. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So, James took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.\n\n## 3: Calculate James's bike ride time\nJames takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Since Jon took 80 minutes for the bike ride, James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.\n\n## 4: Determine James's total time without the run\nAdding James's swim time and bike ride time, we get 36 + 85 = 121 minutes.\n\n## 5: Calculate James's total time including the win margin\nJon won by 10 minutes, which means James's total time was 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. Since Jon's total time was 170 minutes, James's total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.\n\n## 6: Calculate James's run time\nTo find out how long it took James to do the run, we subtract his swim and bike ride time from his total time. James's total time was 180 minutes, and his swim and bike ride time was 121 minutes. So, James's run time is 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{59}$"

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, we divide 200 by 2 to get the initial number of pairs. 200 / 2 = 100 pairs.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total pairs of shoes gained during the week\nOn Monday, Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, and on Friday, he gets 30 pairs. So, the total pairs gained is 5 + 15 + 30 = 50 pairs.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes before getting rid of any on Saturday\nAdding the pairs gained to the initial number of pairs: 100 + 50 = 150 pairs.\n\n## 4: Convert the total number of pairs to individual shoes before getting rid of any on Saturday\nSince each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply 150 pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes. 150 * 2 = 300 shoes.\n\n## 5: Calculate the number of shoes after getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday\nFireman Frank gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. So, we subtract 180 from 300. 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$"

            "## Step 1: Determine the cost-effectiveness of each type of wood for making popsicle sticks.\nFirst, let's calculate how many popsicle sticks Frederick can get per dollar for each type of wood. For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, he can get 200 sticks for $4. This means he gets 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar. For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can get 400 sticks for $6. This means he gets 400 / 6 \u2248 66.67 sticks per dollar.\n\n## 2: Identify the cheapest lumber based on the cost-effectiveness calculation.\nSince 66.67 sticks per dollar is more than 50 sticks per dollar, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is more cost-effective.\n\n## 3: Calculate the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget if he buys the cheapest lumber.\nFrederick has $24 to spend on wood. If he buys only 2 x 8 pieces of wood, which is the cheapest option at $6 per piece, he can buy $24 / $6 = 4 pieces of wood. Since he can get 400 sticks from one piece of 2 x 8 wood, he can get 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.\n\n## 4: Verify if buying the cheaper wood could be more cost-effective in combination.\nLet's verify if buying 2 x 4 wood in combination with 2 x 8 wood could be more cost-effective or if there's a better combination. However, since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, the optimal strategy under the given conditions is to use as much of the budget as possible on 2 x 8 wood.\n\n## 5: Confirm the optimal strategy.\nThe optimal strategy is to spend all $24 on 2 x 8 wood because it provides the most sticks per dollar. We've already calculated that with $24, Frederick can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1600}$"

The oven is set to 450 but reaches 468. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.\n\n## 2: Calculate the percentage deviation.\nTo find the percentage deviation, we divide the difference by the set temperature and then multiply by 100.

The actual temperature is x + 4% of x, which should equal 520.\n\n## 4: Set up the equation to solve for x.\nThe equation based on the information is x + 0.04x = 520.

Let's denote the smallest angle as \\(S\\), the angle that is twice the smallest as \\(2S\\), and the angle that is three times the smallest as \\(3S\\).\n\n## Step 2: Write down the equation based on the given information.\nSince the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation: \\(S + 2S + 3S = 180\\).\n\n## 3: Solve the equation for \\(S\\).\nCombining like terms, we get \\(6S = 180\\). Dividing both sides by 6 gives \\(S = 30\\).\n\n## 4: Find the measures of all angles.\nThe smallest angle is \\(S = 30\\) degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest is \\(2S = 2 \\times 30 = 60\\) degrees. The angle that is three times the smallest is \\(3S = 3 \\times 30 = 90\\) degrees.\n\n## 5: Determine the largest angle.\nComparing the three angles, \\(30\\), \\(60\\), and \\(90\\) degrees, the largest angle is \\(90\\) degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$"

            "## Step 1: Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars\nFirst, we need to find out how much the company paid to acquire each car. Since the company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire it, and each car costs $25,000, the acquisition cost per car is 30% of $25,000. So, 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars\nJames sold 10 cars at $25,000 each. So, the total revenue from selling the cars is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total cost to acquire the 10 cars\nThe total cost to acquire 10 cars at $7,500 each is 10 * $7,500 = $75,000.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total profit\nThe total profit from selling the 10 cars is the total revenue minus the total acquisition cost. So, the total profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.\n\n## 5: Calculate James' commission\nJames got a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500.\n\nThe final answer is: $17,500"

Given that only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate this as 25% of 100 riders. So, 25% of 100 is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.\n\n## 2: Determine the number of women who can stay upright on the wave.\nNext, we find out how many of these riders who can stay upright are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate this as 60% of 25 riders. So, 60% of 25 is 0.60 * 25 = 15 women.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of men who can stay upright on the wave.\nFinally, to find out how many men can stay upright, we subtract the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright. So, the number of men is 25 total riders who can stay upright - 15 women = 10 men.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. We can write an equation:\n\n9x + 10 = 100\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n9x = 100 - 10\n9x = 90\nx = 90 / 9\nx = 10\n\nSo, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long. \n\nThe final answer is 10."

So, the number of movies in series is 600 / 3 = 200 movies.\n\n## 2: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.\nSince Mike can get these movies for $6 each, which is 60% of the normal cost (or 6/10 = 0.6), the total cost for the series movies is 200 * $6 = $1200.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of remaining movies after removing the series movies.\nThe total number of movies minus the series movies is 600 - 200 = 400 movies.\n\n## 4: Calculate the number of older movies.\n40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies. So, the number of older movies is 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies.\n\n## 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.\nEach older movie costs $5.

We know the total time spent driving and hiking is 6 hours, and the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours. So, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total distance hiked by the Llesis family.\nIt took them 1.5 hours to hike at a speed of 20 miles per hour.

So, to make a 3-inch tall mosaic, he needs:\n\n3 inches * 12 chips/square inch = 36 chips per inch of length\n\nSince he has 144 chips in total, we can divide that by 36 chips per inch of length to find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic:\n\n144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches\n\nSo, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long if he wants it to be 3 inches tall. \n\nThe answer is 4."

            "To solve this problem, let's follow the sequence of events:\n\n1. Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.\n2. He then sold 150 butterscotch candies. Since he only had 100 ordered, he must have sold more than he had, which means he didn't actually have 150 to sell. He could only sell 100, and he still owed 50.\n3.

So effectively, he has 100 - 50 = 50 candies to make up the debt and fulfill orders.\n\nHowever, to find out how many he still needs to sell to sell all of his candy (considering both what he has and what he owes), let's add what he has in stock and what he owes:\n\n- He has 100 candies.\n- He owes 50 candies.\n\nIn total, he has or owes 150 candies. \n\nBut to directly answer the question: Since Dale effectively needs to cover 150 candies in orders (100 he has + 50 he owes), and he's asking how many more he needs to sell to fulfill all orders (what he has plus what he owes), we see:\n\nThe final count of candies he needs to sell to fulfill all orders (what he actually has plus what he still owes) is simply 150. \n\nBut if you are strictly interpreting \"sell all of his candy\" to mean only what he currently has on hand plus what he ordered to cover his debt:\n\nThe answer is 50."

Two of his friends play half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter. One friend plays 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he plays for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter.\n\n## 2: Convert the total playing time to minutes\nThey play for 4 hours, which equals 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of quarters each person uses\nLet's denote the number of quarters Jack uses as J, the number of quarters his two worse friends use as F1 and F2 (assuming they play the same amount of time), and the number of quarters his better friend uses as F3.\n\n## 4: Formulate the equations based on their playing times and quarters\nFor Jack: 20J minutes\nFor each of the two worse friends: 10F1 and 10F2 minutes (assuming F1 = F2)\nFor the better friend: 30F3 minutes\n\n## 5: Since they all play together, their total playing time must add up to 240 minutes\nThe equation becomes: 20J + 10F1 + 10F2 + 30F3 = 240\n\n## 6: Since they use quarters to play, we need to find integer solutions for J, F1, F2, and F3 that satisfy the equation\nHowever, to simplify, let's assume they play an equal number of quarters and see if that fits. If they played an equal amount of time per quarter, the ratio of their playtimes would directly inform the quarters used.\n\n## 7: Simplify by finding a common basis for comparison\nA common approach is to find the least common multiple or to directly calculate based on given ratios. Given Jack plays for 20 minutes, his friends for 10 and 30 minutes, let's assume they play a certain number of rounds that add up to 240 minutes.\n\n## 8: Calculate based on average playtime per quarter\nThe average playtime per quarter for the group can be calculated by finding a weighted average or by directly solving the given problem through another approach.\n\n## 9: Direct Calculation Approach\nLet's assume Jack plays x quarters, then his two friends play 2x quarters (since they play half as long, they need twice the quarters for the same time), and his best friend plays x/1.5 quarters (or 2x/3 quarters) for the same amount of time.\n\n## 10: Calculate Total Quarters Used\nThe total time played is 240 minutes. Let's express each person's playtime in terms of x (the number of quarters Jack plays):\n- Jack: 20x minutes\n- Two friends: 2 * 10x = 20x minutes\n- Best friend: 30 * (2x/3) = 20x minutes\n\n## 11: Sum of Playtimes Equals Total Time\n20x + 20x + 20x = 240 * 3 / 20 (simplified to find x) does not apply directly; instead:\n60x = 240\n\n## 12: Solve for x\nx = 240 / 60 = 4\n\n## 13: Calculate Total Quarters\nJack uses 4 quarters, his two friends use 2 * 8 = 16 quarters (8 each, since 2x = 2*4 = 8), and his best friend uses 2*4/3 = 8/3 quarters.\n\n## 14: Correct Calculation\nLet's correct that: If Jack plays 4 quarters (80 minutes), his friends play 8 quarters (80 minutes each), and the best friend plays 8/3 quarters (80 minutes).\n\n## 15: Final Calculation of Quarters\nThe best friend plays for 30 minutes per quarter. For 240 minutes total playtime: \nThe equation to solve should reflect total quarters used directly.\n\n## 16: Calculate Total Quarters Used Correctly\nGiven:\n- Jack: 4 hours = 240 minutes, plays 20 minutes per quarter. So, in 240 minutes, he would play 240/20 = 12 quarters if alone.\n- But they play together. Let's assume total quarters used is Q. Then:\n  - Jack's time: 20Q1\n  - Two friends' time: 10Q2 each\n  - Friend 3's time: 30Q3\n\n## 17: Finalize the Thought Process\nIf we consider their playing ratio and total playtime (240 minutes), and assuming equal distribution isn't directly calculable without ratios:\nThe total playtime ratio or quarters should directly inform total cost.\n\n## 18: Final Calculation"

If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price will be reduced by $200. So, the final cost of the laptop will be $600 - $200 = $400.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total amount of money Erika has from her job, her mom, and the extra she needs.\nErika was paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom agreed to give her $80. So, the total amount of money she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230. She also needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total amount of money Erika has in total, including her purse.\nSince Erika needs $50 more to buy the laptop and the laptop costs $400 after the trade-in, she must have $400 - $50 = $350 in total.\n\n## 4: Calculate the amount of money Erika has in her purse.\nWe know that Erika has $230 from her job and her mom. So, to find out how much she has in her purse, we subtract this amount from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$"

Therefore, the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount is 3 * $16 = $48.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the discount.\nThe total cost is the sum of the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the discount. So, the total cost is $75 + $48 = $123.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{123}$"

Their 2 children will eat 2 bowls of soup. In total, 2 + 2 = 4 bowls of soup will be eaten for dinner.\n\n## 3: Convert the total dinner consumption into a common unit\nSince the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls. For dinner, 2 adults eat 2 bowls, which is equivalent to 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls. The 2 children eat 2 child bowls. So, in total, 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls are eaten for dinner.\n\n## 4: Calculate the leftover soup after dinner\nThe pot can fill 8 child bowls. After 6 child bowls are eaten, 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls of soup are left.\n\n## 5: Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup\nThere are 2 child bowls of soup left and 2 children. So, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"

Distance = speed * time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles.\n\n## 2: Calculate the distance the bird travels north on the second leg of the journey.\nThe bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles.\n\n## 3: Calculate the distance the bird travels south on the third leg of the journey.\nThe bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles.\n\n## 4: Determine the net distance the bird travels south.\nThe bird initially travels 300 miles south, then 36 miles north, and finally 110 miles south. To find the total distance south, we need to consider the northward movement as subtracting from the southward movement. So, the net distance south = 300 - 36 + 110.\n\n## 5: Calculate the net distance south.\nNet distance south = 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{374}$"

            "## Step 1: Convert the length of the flower bed to inches\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the flower bed into inches because the width of each plant is given in inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, then 111 feet = 111 * 12 inches = 1332 inches.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total space one plant and its gap will occupy\nEach plant grows 12 inches wide, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches) between every plant. So, the total space one plant and its gap will occupy is 12 inches (plant) + 18 inches (gap) = 30 inches.\n\n## 3: Determine the maximum number of plants that can fit in the flower bed\nTo find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed in inches by the total space one plant and its gap will occupy. So, 1332 inches / 30 inches per plant and gap = 44.4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, Pat can only plant 44 plants.\n\n## 4: Calculate how many more plants Pat needs to buy\nPat already owns 17 flowers, and she can only plant 44 plants in total. So, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.\n\n## 5: Calculate the total cost of the plants Pat needs to buy\nEach flowering plant costs $6. To find out how much money Pat will spend, we multiply the number of plants she needs to buy by the cost per plant. So, 27 plants * $6 per plant = $162.\n\nThe final answer is: $162"

So, her rate of cooking shrimp is 30 shrimp / 10 minutes = 3 shrimp per minute.\n\nNow, let's calculate how long it would take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp.\n\n- **Peeling 90 Shrimp:** At a rate of 6 shrimp per minute, to peel 90 shrimp, it would take 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.\n- **Cooking 90 Shrimp:** At a rate of 3 shrimp per minute, to cook 90 shrimp, it would take 90 / 3 = 30 minutes.\n\nHowever, peeling and cooking can be done simultaneously. So, we don't need to add the times together but rather find the longer operation since they can overlap.\n\nThe longer operation is cooking, which takes 30 minutes.

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can express Bill's age as \\(3D\\).\n\n## 2: Calculate the time elapsed between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it.\nBill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet. When Bill saw the comet, his dad was \\(D + 75\\) years old because 75 years had passed since he saw the comet.

The difference in their ages is constant, so when Bill's dad was 30, Bill was \\(3D - (D + 75)\\) years old, but to find Bill's age when he first saw the comet, we focus on the fact that 75 years passed between their sightings.\n\n## 5: Solve for D and then find Bill's age when he first saw the comet.\nGiven that Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet, and the comet comes every 75 years, when Bill saw the comet, his dad was \\(30 + 75 = 105\\) years old. Since Bill was \\(3D\\) and his dad was \\(D + 75\\), setting \\(D + 75 = 105\\) gives \\(D = 30\\). This confirms Bill's dad's age progression but to find Bill's age when he saw the comet: \\(3D = 3 * 30 = 90\\).\n\n## 6: Calculate Bill's age when he first saw the comet.\nThe comet comes every 75 years.

            "## Step 1: Define the known variables\nLet's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as $A$, $B$, $H$, and $W$ respectively. We know that $A = 3$, $B = 4$, and the total age of the children is $20$, so $A + B + H + W = 20$. We are also told that $H = 2 \\times \\text{average age of the group}$.\n\n## 2: Express the average age of the group\nThe average age of the group is $\\frac{A + B + H + W}{4}$. Since $H = 2 \\times \\text{average age of the group}$, we can write $H = 2 \\times \\frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \\frac{A + B + H + W}{2}$.\n\n## 3: Substitute known values into the equation for total age\nGiven $A = 3$ and $B = 4$, we substitute these into the total age equation: $3 + 4 + H + W = 20$. This simplifies to $7 + H + W = 20$.\n\n## 4: Express $H$ in terms of $A$, $B$, $H$, and $W$\nFrom Step 2, we have $H = \\frac{A + B + H + W}{2}$. Multiplying both sides by $2$ gives $2H = A + B + H + W$. Subtracting $H$ from both sides yields $H = A + B + W$.\n\n## 5: Substitute $H$ from Step 4 into the simplified total age equation\nSubstituting $H = A + B + W$ into $7 + H + W = 20$, and knowing $A = 3$ and $B = 4$, we get $7 + (3 + 4 + W) + W = 20$. This simplifies to $7 + 7 + 2W = 20$.\n\n## 6: Solve for $W$\nSimplifying further, $14 + 2W = 20$. Subtracting $14$ from both sides gives $2W = 6$. Dividing both sides by $2$ yields $W = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"

So, the weekly cost for renting the studio is 3 * $25 = $75.\n\n## 2: Calculate the weekly cost for the students.\nThere are 10 students and it costs $1.50 per student per session. The studio is rented 3 days a week. So, the weekly cost for the students is 10 * $1.50 * 3 = $45.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total weekly cost.\nThe total weekly cost is the sum of the weekly cost of renting the studio and the weekly cost for the students. Total weekly cost = $75 + $45 = $120.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total monthly cost.\nSince there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total monthly cost is 4 * $120 = $480.\n\n## 5: Calculate the weekly earnings.\nThe weekly earnings come from 10 students at $1.50 per student per session for 3 sessions. So, the weekly earnings are 10 * $1.50 * 3 = $45.\n\n## 6: Calculate the monthly earnings.\nThe monthly earnings would then be 4 * $45 = $180.\n\n## 7: Realize that total earnings should consider both the cost and the income properly.\nThe calculation of earnings should consider the income from students minus the expenses. The income from students per week is $45 (as calculated in step 5). The expenses per week are $120 (as calculated in step 3). So, the weekly loss or negative earnings would be $120 - $45 = -$75.\n\n## 8: Correct the approach for calculating expected earnings.\nThe expected earnings should actually be recalculated focusing on the income. Each student pays $1.50 per session, and there are 3 sessions a week. So, each student pays $1.50 * 3 = $4.50 per week. With 10 students, that's 10 * $4.50 = $45 per week.\n\n## 9: Calculate the monthly income from students.\nThe monthly income from students is $45 * 4 = $180.\n\n## 10: Calculate the monthly fixed cost for studio rental.\nThe monthly fixed cost for renting the studio is $25 * 3 * 4 = $300.\n\n## 11: Calculate the monthly variable cost for students.\nThe monthly variable cost for 10 students over 4 weeks (assuming 3 sessions/week) was already considered in calculating total monthly costs before.\n\n## 12: Final calculation for expected earnings.\nThe total monthly cost for the studio and students is the fixed cost of renting plus the variable cost for students: $300 (fixed) + $180 (variable, 10 students * $1.5 * 3 * 4) = $480. The income is $180. Thus, the expected earnings (or profit) in a month would actually be the income from students minus the total costs: $180 (income) - ($300 + $180) is incorrect because we must account for costs and income properly.\n\n## 13: Final calculation correction.\nThe income per month from 10 students is $180. The cost to rent the studio 3 days a week for a month is $300. The cost for students for a month is $180. So, total costs are $300 (studio) + $180 (students) = $480. The expected earnings (profit) = Total Income - Total Costs. However, the total income should reflect what students pay per session.\n\n## 14: Proper Income Calculation.\n10 students * $1.50 * 3 sessions/week = $45/week. For a month, that's $45 * 4 = $180.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{180}$"

So, Wanda pumped 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.\n\n## 2: Calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day.\nMs. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank on the first day. Since Wanda pumped 4500 gallons, Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.\n\n## 3: Calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day.\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day. Since Wanda pumped 4500 gallons on the first day, on the second day, she pumped 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.\n\n## 4: Calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. Since Ms. B pumped 3375 gallons on the first day, on the second day, she pumped 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.\n\n## 5: Calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days.\nThe total amount of water pumped by Wanda is 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons. The total amount of water pumped by Ms. B is 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days is 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons.\n\n## 6: Calculate the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full.\nThe tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, and 12000 gallons were pumped into the tank. So, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6000}$"

This means that 91% of the charge remains each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as \\(x \\times (0.91)^5\\).\n\n## 3: Calculate the charge after the next 3 hours.\nFor the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour, meaning 93% of the charge remains each hour.

So, for 4 twin beds, he needs to do laundry in 2 loads (since 4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads).\n- **King Size Bed:** He has 1 king size bed, and the machine can wash 1 king set of sheets at a time. So, that's 1 load.\n\nIn total, Greg does 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads of laundry per week.\n\n### Yearly Laundry:\n\nTo find out how many loads he does in a year, we multiply the weekly loads by the number of weeks in a year:\n\n3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year\n\nSo, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year."

Therefore, he needs 6 pounds of butter.\n\n2. **Understand the promotion:** The grocery store has a promotion where if you buy one pound of butter, you get a second pound half off. \n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the butter with the promotion:** \n    - For every 2 pounds of butter, you pay $4.00 for the first pound and $2.00 for the second pound (half off), for a total of $6.00 for 2 pounds.\n    - Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, you can calculate the cost as follows: \n        - 6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets\n        - 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00\n\n4. **Alternative calculation for verification:**\n    - Normally, 6 pounds of butter would cost 6 * $4.00 = $24.00\n    - With the promotion, for every 2 pounds, you save $2.00 (from $8.00 for 2 pounds to $6.00 for 2 pounds)\n    - For 6 pounds, you would have 3 pairs of pounds, so you save 3 * $2.00 = $6.00\n    - $24.00 - $6.00 = $18.00\n\n**Conclusion:** It will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion."

Since a dozen roses cost $15 and there are 12 roses in a dozen, the cost per rose is $15 / 12 = $1.25 per rose. However, it's also given that roses cost $2 each, which seems to contradict the cost per rose calculated from the dozen price. Given the information, we should consider the $2 each as a direct price for individual roses not bought in bulk. Therefore, 15 roses at $2 each will cost 15 * $2 = $30.\n\n## 2: Determine the total amount of money Jenny has\nJenny arrives with five $5 bills, which totals to 5 * $5 = $25.\n\n## 3: Calculate the change Jenny should receive\nJenny spent $30 on roses but only had $25. This means she is short $30 - $25 = $5.\n\n## 4: Convert the change into quarters\nSince they only have quarters for change and Jenny is short $5, we need to convert $5 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so $5 will be 5 * 4 = 20 quarters.\n\n## 5: Determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with\nGiven that Jenny was short $5 and the florist gives her 20 quarters as change, Jenny leaves with these 20 quarters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"

            "To solve this problem, let's calculate the number of bales the farmer makes and the number of bales the truck picks up over a 6-hour day.\n\nThe farmer makes 5 bales per hour. Over 6 hours, the farmer makes:\n5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales\n\nThe truck picks up 3 bales per hour. Over 6 hours, the truck picks up:\n3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales\n\nNow, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:\n30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales\n\nSo, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.\n\nAnswer: 12 bales."

            "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per day\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of classes John has per day. A normal student has 6 periods, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so John spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class per day.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per week\nSince John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total number of minutes he spends in class per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday\nJohn spends 1/16 of his weekly class minutes on extra learning each on Saturday and Sunday. So, the total minutes he spends on extra learning on the weekends is 2 * (1/16 * 1600) = 2 * 100 = 200 minutes.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning per week\nThe total number of minutes John spends learning per week is the sum of the minutes he spends in class during the week and the minutes he spends on extra learning on the weekends. So, the total minutes per week is 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.\n\n## 5: Convert the total number of minutes John spends learning per week to hours\nTo convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total hours per week John spends learning is 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"

Given her current salary is $100,000, her annual savings rate is 20% of $100,000, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.\n\n## 2: Calculate the annual living expenses during retirement.\nLauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement. 40% of $100,000 is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.\n\n## 3: Determine the total savings needed for retirement.\nLauren plans to save for a 20-year retirement period and live on $40,000 per year during that time. The total savings needed for retirement is $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.\n\n## 4: Calculate how much more Lauren needs to save.\nSince Lauren already has a portion of her savings (though not specified how much she has, we will assume she has none for this calculation), we will calculate how much she needs to save in total and then derive the years needed to achieve this. The total amount she needs to save is $800,000.\n\n## 5: Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement.\nLauren saves $20,000 per year. To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we divide the total savings needed by her annual savings: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.\n\n## 6: Since the question asks how many more years Lauren needs to work, assuming she hasn't started saving yet or has just started, we consider the 40 years as the total needed.\nThe question seems to imply that Lauren has not yet started saving or is asking for how long she needs to work to achieve her goal without specifying any current savings. Therefore, she needs to work for 40 years to achieve her goal.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{40}$"

Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior took more than 4 + 4 = 8 hours. However, the phrase \"well over\" implies that Dior took more than 8 hours, but for the purpose of calculation and without a specific number given, we will consider \"well over 4 hours longer\" as exactly 4 hours longer for a basic calculation, which might not fully capture the \"well over\" but provides a starting point.

We know it takes John 2 hours to drive one way at a speed of 70 mph. \n\n   The formula to calculate distance is: distance = speed \u00d7 time\n   \n   So, for one way: distance = 70 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 140 miles\n\n2. **Round trip distance**: Since we are considering the round trip (there and back), we need to double the one way distance.\n\n   Round trip distance = 2 \u00d7 140 miles = 280 miles\n\n3. **Monthly visits**: John visits his parents twice a month.\n\n4. **Total miles driven in a month**: To find out how many miles he drives in a month for these visits, we multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits.\n\n   Total miles a month = 280 miles \u00d7 2 = 560 miles\n\nSo, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."

So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / (2/3 hours) = 2 * (3/2) = 3 mph.\n\n## 2: Calculate Grandma's speed on the sidewalk\nWe're told that on the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. Since her speed on the beach is 3 mph, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 3 = 6 mph.\n\n## 3: Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk\nGrandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of 6 mph. Time = Distance / Speed. So, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 6 mph = 1/6 hours. Converting 1/6 hours into minutes, we get (1/6) * 60 = 10 minutes.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total time for the entire walk\nThe total time for the entire walk is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk. Time on the beach = 40 minutes. Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes. Total time = 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{50}$"

Since there are 1040 apartments, he makes 3 * 1040 = 3120 collections in a week.\n\n## 5: Calculate John's weekly earnings.\nJohn gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, for 3120 collections, he earns 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.\n\nThe final answer is: $1248"

So, Jay can build 20 / 4 = 5 snowballs in 15 minutes.\n\n## 2: Calculate the net number of snowballs Jay has after 15 minutes.\nIn 15 minutes, Jay builds 5 snowballs but 2 melt. So, the net gain is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs every 15 minutes.\n\n## 3: Determine how many 15-minute intervals are needed to have 60 snowballs.\nTo find out how long it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we first need to see how many 15-minute intervals it takes. Since Jay builds snowballs at a rate that needs to be calculated over time considering both building and melting, let's correct the approach focusing on the hourly rate and melting.\n\n## 4: Calculate Jay's hourly net gain of snowballs.\nJay builds 20 snowballs in an hour. Every hour, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes. So, in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt. Thus, Jay's net gain per hour is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.\n\n## 5: Calculate the time needed to have 60 snowballs.\nTo have 60 snowballs with a net gain of 12 snowballs per hour, we divide 60 by 12.

We'll subtract this amount from the total amount of feed Dexter ordered.\n\n1. Calculate how much feed one pig eats in a day:\n   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, one pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.\n\n2. Calculate how much feed all five pigs eat in a day:\n   - Since Dexter has 5 pigs, and each eats 8 pounds of feed per day, all the pigs eat 5 * 8 = 40 pounds of feed per day.\n\n3. Calculate how much feed all five pigs eat in a week:\n   - There are 7 days in a week. So, in a week, the pigs eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.\n\n4. Calculate how much feed is left after a week:\n   - Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After the pigs eat 280 pounds in a week, the amount of feed left is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.\n\nThe answer is: 20 pounds of feed are left after a week."

Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays the full price for one T-shirt and 50% of the price for the second T-shirt. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, Jake pays $8 for the first T-shirt and $8 * 0.5 = $4 for the second T-shirt.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total cost of the T-shirts\nThe total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.\n\n## 3: Calculate the cost of the shoes\nThe original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. So, the discount on the shoes is $40 * 0.4 = $16. Therefore, Jake pays $40 - $16 = $24 for the shoes.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total amount spent at the store\nTo find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we add the cost of the T-shirts to the cost of the shoes. So, $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.\n\nThe final answer is: $36"

However, Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron does. Let's denote the distance Aaron runs as $d$ miles and the distance Vanessa runs as $2d$ miles.\n\n## 2: Determine the distance Aaron ran.\nGiven that Vanessa ran 4 miles and she runs twice as far as Aaron, we can deduce that Aaron ran $4 / 2 = 2$ miles.\n\n## 3: Calculate Aaron's speed.\nSince Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes, and we know he runs 1 mile in $x/2$ minutes, we can find his speed. If 1 mile takes him $x/2$ minutes, then 2 miles take him $2 \\times (x/2) = x$ minutes. Given that 2 miles take him 16 minutes, we find $x = 16$ minutes for 2 miles. This implies 1 mile takes Aaron $16 / 2 = 8$ minutes.\n\n## 4: Calculate Vanessa's speed.\nSince Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, and Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa runs 1 mile in $8 \\times 2 = 16$ minutes.\n\n## 5: Calculate the time Vanessa took to complete her part.\nGiven Vanessa ran 4 miles and 1 mile takes her 16 minutes, she completed her part in $4 \\times 16 = 64$ minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{64}$"

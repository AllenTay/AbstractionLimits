A new approach could involve using the numbers to create a factor of 24 or an intermediate result that can be easily converted to 24.\n\n## 2: Explore Creating an Intermediate Target\nConsider creating an intermediate target like 3 or 4, which can be easily multiplied to get 24. Notice that \\(8 / (5 - 5)\\) does not work because it results in division by zero. However, let's think about using \\(5 + 5 = 10\\), \\(13 - 8 = 5\\), or similar simple combinations.\n\n## 3: Apply the New Approach\nLet's try combining numbers to get 24 directly or an easy multiple. Consider \\(13 + 5 + 5 + 1\\) but there's no 1. However, \\(5 * 5 - 1 = 24\\) doesn't work because there's no 1. What about using \\(8 * ? = 24\\), so \\(? = 3\\). Can we make 3? Yes, \\(13 - 5 - 5 = 3\\).\n\n## 4: Construct a Solution\nUsing the idea from Step 3, we have \\(8 * (13 - 5 - 5) = 8 * 3 = 24\\). This equation uses each of the numbers 5, 5, 8, and 13 exactly once.\n\n## 5: Validate the Solution\nThe equation \\(8 * (13 - 5 - 5) = 24\\) is valid. Let's write it out: \\(8 * (13 - 10) = 8 * 3 = 24\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\nAnswer: 8 * (13 - 5 - 5) = 24"

            "## Step 1: Analyze the given numbers and the goal\nWe need to use the numbers 2, 4, 9, and 12 exactly once to make 24 using the operations +, -, *, /.\n\n## 2: Explore different combinations and operations\nGiven the numbers, let's try combining them in various ways. A previous attempt successfully used 2 * 12 = 24, but we need to see if there's another solution.\n\n## 3: Try combining 9 and 4\nLet's combine 9 and 4: 9 + 4 = 13. Then, we have 2 and 12 left. We can try to get close to 24/13 or use them directly.\n\n## 4: Explore using 2 and 12 with the result of 9 + 4\nWe have 13 from 9 + 4. Multiplying 13 by 2 gives 26, which is close but 2 units too high.\n\n## 5: Adjust the approach to fit\nConsider 12 / 4 = 3, then 9 + 3 = 12, and finally 12 * 2 = 24.\n\n## 6: Verify the solution\nUsing the operations: 12 / 4 = 3, then 9 + 3 = 12, and 12 * 2 = 24. This solution uses all numbers exactly once.\n\n## 7: Write down the solution\nThe equation would be: (12 / 4) + 9) * 2 = (3 + 9) * 2 = 12 * 2 = 24.\n\n## 8: Format the solution correctly\nAnswer: (12 / 4 + 9) * 2 = 24 \n\nHowever, to strictly follow the format and provide clarity:\nAnswer: (9 + 12/4) * 2"

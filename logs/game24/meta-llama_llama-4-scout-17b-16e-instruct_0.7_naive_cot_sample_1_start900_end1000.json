We need to use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to obtain 24.\n\n## Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nLet's try to find a combination that works. One approach is to try and get close to 24 or to create a number that, when combined with another, equals 24.\n\n## 3: Identify a potential solution\nNotice that 11 - 1 = 10, and we have 10 and 8 left. We can then try to combine these numbers to get 24.\n\n## 4: Construct the solution\nIf we do 10 + 8 = 18, we're not there yet. However, 10 + 8 = 18 and 18 + ? = 24 suggests we need 6 more. But let's look at it differently: 8 / (1 - (no direct operation)) doesn't help directly. But what if we use 11 and 1 to get 10, then use 10 and 8 to get 18, and find a way to use what's left to get to 24?\n\n## 5: Direct approach to solution\nConsider 10 + 11 = 21, then 21 + 8 = 29 which is too high. Or, 11 * (8 / (10 - ?)) doesn't fit. But, (10 - 1) = 9, then 9 * (8 / ? ) or similar doesn't fit neatly.\n\n## 6: Solution identification\nHowever, looking closely: 8 * (11 - 10) = 8 * 1 = 8; not there. But (11 - 1) * (10 / 8) or similar. Let's calculate: 11 + 10 = 21; 21 - 8 = 13; too complicated. Simpler: 10 * (8 / (11- ?)).\n\n## 7: Final calculation\nDirect calculation: (11+1) = 12; 12 * 2 = 24; but no 2. Yet, (10 + 8) = 18; 18 + (11 - 1) = 18 + 10 = 28; still not. Yet, 11 * (10 - 8) = 11 * 2 = 22; close. What about: 8 * 3 = 24; 11 - 10 + 1 = 2; no. But 10 - 8 = 2; 11 * (10 - 8) too low.\n\n## 8: Last attempt\nLet's think about division and multiplication more: Can we make 24 directly? What if we get a 3 and an 8? Or a 4 and a 6? We have 1, 8, 10, 11. So 10 + 1 = 11; 11 - 8 = 3; 3 * 8 = 24.\n\n## 9: Construct the final expression\nThe steps are: 10 + 1 = 11 (left: 11, 8); 11 - 8 = 3 (left: 3); 3 * 8 = 24. So, the expression is: (10 + 1) - 8) * 8 = 24 or more accurately reflects as: 8 * (10 + 1 - 8) = 8 * (11 - 8) = 8 * 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8 * (10 + 1 - 8) =24}$"

Let's simplify: 7 * 4 = 28, 28 - 5 = 23, 23 + 9 = 32. No. \n\n## 6: Direct approach to solution\nLet's consider 9 * (5 - 4) = 9, not helpful. But (9 - 4) = 5, and 5 * (7 - 5) does not directly apply. Consider directly getting to 24: 4 * ( ) = 24 or similar.\n\n## 7: Simplify by finding a pair\nGiven numbers 4, 5, 7, 9. What if 7 + 5 = 12, then 12 * 2 = 24, but no 2. However, 9 - 5 = 4 and 4 * 7 = 28 which does not help. Notice 5 * 4 = 20, 20 + 7 - 3 is not possible. \n\n## 8: Consider division\nNotice 7 - 5 = 2, then 9 * 4 / 2 = 18. Too low.\n\n## 9: Specific calculation\nHowever,  (7 + 9) = 16, 16 - 4 = 12, 12 * 2 is not possible without a 2. But 9 + 7 = 16, 5 + 4 = 9, 16 / 9 * 9 does not work.\n\n## 10: Final calculation\nConsider 4 * 9 = 36, 36 - 12 = 24. Can get 12 from 7 + 5. So, 4 * 9 - (7 + 5) = 36 - 12 = 24.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4 * 9 - (7 + 5)}$"

Noticing the numbers, 12 is already close to 24, and we have two 6s and a 7.\n\n## 3: Consider using 12 to get closer to 24\nSince 12 * 2 = 24, we need to find a way to get a 2 using the remaining numbers (6, 6, 7).\n\n## 4: Find a way to obtain 2\nTo get 2, we can subtract one 6 from the other: 6 - 6 = 0, which does not help, or we can try 7 - 6 = 1 and then 6 - 1 = 5, which still doesn't directly help. However, 7 - 5 = 2 is not directly possible since we only have 6s and not a 5. But, 6 / 6 = 1 and 7 - 1 = 6, then 6 * 6 / 6 = 6, which does not directly help. A simpler approach would be to directly use 6 and 6 to get 12 and then find a multiplier or addend.\n\n## 5: Direct approach to 24\nConsider 6 + 6 = 12, then 12 + 12 = 24. This directly uses all numbers.\n\n## 6: Formulate the expression\nThe expression could be 12 + (6 + 6) = 24, but we need to use the operations given and exactly two numbers at a time. So, (6 + 6) = 12, then 12 + 12 = 24. The correct formulation respecting the rules would thus involve: 6 + 6 = 12, then 12 * 2 = 24, but we only have one 12 and one 2 is not directly available. However, 7 - 6 = 1, 6 * 1 = 6, 12 + 6 = 18, still not there. Let's correct the approach.\n\n## 7: Correct the approach\nGiven numbers: 6, 6, 7, 12. A straightforward calculation: 6 * (7 - 6) = 6 * 1 = 6, then 6 * 12 / 6 = 12, not helping. But, what if we do 6 * 7 = 42, 42 - 12 = 30, 30 - 6 = 24.\n\n## 8: Formulate the correct expression\nThe expression could be: 6 * 7 = 42, then 42 - 12 = 30, and 30 - 6 = 24. So, 6 * (7 - (12 / 6)) is not correct based on operations. The right sequence is: 6 * 7 = 42, 42 - 6 = 36, 36 - 12 = 24.\n\n## 9: Final expression\nThe final expression respecting two numbers at a time and basic operations: (6 * 7 - 6) - 12 = (42 - 6) - 12 = 36 - 12 = 24. Therefore, (6 * 7 - 6) - 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(6 * 7 - 6) - 12}$"

One approach is to try and get close to 24 or to create a number that, when combined with another, results in 24.\n\n## 3: Identify a potential solution\nNotice that 11 + 9 = 20, and 20 + 6 - 9 = 17, which does not help directly. However, considering 9 * (11 - 6) could be promising because it involves a multiplication and a subtraction, which might lead to 24.\n\n## 4: Calculate using the identified potential solution\nCalculate 9 * (11 - 6) = 9 * 5 = 45, which is too high.\n\n## 5: Explore another potential solution\nConsider 9 + 9 = 18, and then 18 + 6 = 24.

Noting that 12 is already a significant portion of 24, we can consider operations involving 12.\n\n## 3: Consider using 12 and another number to get close to 24\nIf we use 12 and add or multiply with another number, we might get close to 24. For example, 12 + 10 = 22, which is close but not there yet. We need an additional 2 to reach 24.\n\n## 4: Find a way to get 2 using the remaining numbers\nThe remaining numbers are 5, 13, and 5. We can try to get 2 by using these numbers. One possible way is 13 - 5 - 5 = 3, which does not give us 2 directly, but 5 - 5 = 0 does not help. However, 13 - 10 = 3 (if we had used 10 in a different step) or directly trying to make 2: 5 / 5 = 1, then 1 + ? = 2, but there's no direct way to get 1 and then 2 with the remaining numbers efficiently.\n\n## 5: Explore alternative steps starting with different operations\nConsider 13 - 5 = 8, then 8 + ? = 24 or 8 * ? = 24. For 8 * ? = 24, ? needs to be 3. So, 5 - 2 = 3, but we only have 5, 10, and 12 left, and no 2.\n\n## 6: Direct approach to solve\nAnother approach: 10 + 5 = 15, 15 + 13 = 28, which is too high. Let's try: 13 - 10 = 3, then 12 / 3 = 4, and 4 * 5 = 20, still not there. Or, 5 * 5 = 25, then 25 - 13 = 12, and 12 - 10 = 2, which does not help directly.\n\n## 7: Successful combination\nConsider this: (12 / 4) does not work since 4 is not available, but what if we do 10 + (13 - 5) = 10 + 8 = 18, still short. How about: 13 + 5 = 18, 18 - 10 = 8, 8 * 3 does not work since 3 is not directly available. But: 5 * (13 - 10) = 5 * 3 = 15, add 12 - 15 = -3, does not help.\n\n## 8: Final calculation\nLet's calculate directly with a promising combination: 12 + 5 = 17, 17 + 5 = 22, 22 + 13 = 35, too high. Or, 5 * 10 = 50, 50 - 13 = 37, 37 - 12 = 25, still not it. A simpler path could be: (13 + 5) * (10 / 5) does not directly apply since we calculate step by step. How about: 10 - 5 = 5, then 5 * 5 = 25, and 25 - 1, but there's no 1.\n\n## 9: Solution found\nUpon reviewing, a straightforward solution seems elusive without systematically trying each combination. Consider: 10 + 12 = 22, need 2. 13 - 5 = 8, 8 / 4 does not apply. Direct calculation: 5 + 13 = 18, 18 + 10 = 28, 28 - 12 = 16. Or simply: 12 * (13 - 10) / 5 * 5 or similar does not directly compute. Noticing 12 and 10 are large, (10 - 5) * (12 / 5) = 5 * 12 / 5 = 12. A clear step: (13 - 5) = 8; 8 * 3 = 24, but no 3. Yet, 12 / (5-5) does not work.\n\n## 10: Actual Solution\nThe solution comes from:  (10 + 5) -"

A possible operation is 9 * 3 = 27, which is close but exceeds 24. However, 9 + 3 + 3 = 15, which is not correct. Let's try 3 * 3 = 9, then 9 * ? = 24 or directly use 9 and 3 to get close.\n\n## 5: Find the correct combination\nConsidering 3 * 3 = 9, we still need to get 24/9 = 8/3 or simply use the numbers to directly get 24. Noticing that 10 + 13 = 23, and adding 3 and 9 won't help directly.

Let's adjust: (13 - 3) * (10 / 9) does not directly apply since we need integers. But (10 + 13) = 23, and 23 + 1 (if we had a 1) would be 24. However, 9 - 3 = 6, and 6 * (something) = 24.\n\n## 7: Execute the corrected approach\nFrom 3, 9, 10, 13, if we do 13 - 9 = 4, then 10 - 4 = 6, and 6 * 4 = 24.\n\n## 8: Write down the solution based on the steps\nThe steps can be: 13 - 9 = 4 (left: 3, 4, 10), 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 3, 6), 6 * 4 = 24.

We need to use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to obtain 24.\n\n## Step 2: Explore possible operations with the given numbers\nLet's try combining the numbers in different ways to get close to or reach 24.\n\n## 3: Identify a potential combination\nOne potential combination could be using the two 7s and the 11 to get close to or reach a number that, when combined with the 8, results in 24.\n\n## 4: Test a specific combination\nConsider 11 + 7 = 18, then 18 + 7 = 25. This is too high, and adding or subtracting 8 does not yield 24 directly.\n\n## 5: Test another combination\nConsider 7 * 8 = 56, then 56 / 7 = 8, still not there. Or 8 + 7 = 15, 15 + 7 = 22, and 22 + 11 = 33, which is too high.\n\n## 6: Explore a combination involving division\nConsider 11 - 7 = 4, then 8 / 4 = 2, and 7 * 2 = 14, which does not work.\n\n## 7: Find a correct combination\nConsider 7 + 11 = 18, then 18 - 8 = 10, and 10 * 7/5 is not an option since 5 is not in the numbers. However, looking at it differently: 8 + 7 + 11 = 26, which is close but 26 - 7 = 19, not helpful.\n\n## 8: Discover a viable solution\nA possible solution could be: (11 - 7) = 4, then 8 * 4 = 32, and 32 - 7 = 25, still not it.\n\n## 9: Identify the correct solution\nConsider this: 11 + 7 = 18, 18 + 8 = 26. Too high. But what if we do 7 * (11 - 8) = 7 * 3 = 21, then 21 + 7 = 28, too high.\n\n## 10: Final calculation\nLet's calculate with another approach: (7 + 7) * 8 / 11 does not directly apply since we can't use fractions or multiple operations simultaneously on all numbers. However, looking closely: 8 * (7 - 7 / 11) or similar does not directly apply. But: 7 * 8 = 56; 56 / (7 / 11) does not directly help.\n\n## 11: Direct approach to solution\nDirect calculation: 7 * (8 - 7 / 11) is not straightforward. Simple approach: 11 * 8 = 88; 88 - 7 * 7 = 88 - 49 = 39; too complicated. Simpler: (11 + 7) / 8 * 7 or similar.\n\n## 12: Solution\nThe expression (7 + 11) * (8 - 7) = 18 * 1 = 18 does not work. However, consider: 11 - 8 = 3; 7 * 3 = 21; 21 + 7 = 28. Or: 8 - 7 = 1; 11 * 1 = 11; 11 + 7 * (no). But: 7 + 8 = 15; 15 + 11 - 7 * some does not directly compute.\n\n## 13: Correct expression\nThe expression could be: 7 * 8 - 11 + 7 = 56 - 11 - 7 = 38; too high. Or simply: 8 * (11 - 7) = 8 * 4 = 32; 32 - 7 = 25.\n\n## 14: Actual Solution\nThe correct expression is:  (11+7)/8*? no. But (7*11)-8-7 = 77-15 = 62; no. However: (8*7)-11+7/7 or (8 * 3) + 7 * 1; which does not compute directly.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(7 + 7) * (11 - 8) = 14 * 3 = 42; nope.

We need to use these numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to obtain 24.\n\n## 2: Look for common factor or sum\nNotice that 6 * 4 = 24. This immediately provides a potential solution.\n\n## 3: Construct the solution\nUsing the numbers 4 and 6, we have 6 * 4 = 24. This means we don't actually need to use the other numbers (3 and the second 6) in this particular case, but let's verify if there's a way to construct 24 that uses all given operations and numbers efficiently.\n\n## 4: Explore alternative solutions\nAnother potential solution could involve the two 6s. For instance, 6 + 6 = 12, and then 12 * 2 = 24, but there's no 2. However, 3 * 4 = 12, and 12 * 2 = 24, still no 2.

But if we do 4 * 6 = 24 directly, that's a simple solution.\n\n## 6: Construct the equation\nThe equation can be simply 4 * 6 = 24. Since we have two 6s, we can write it as 6 * (4) = 24 or more elaborately using the other 6: 6 * 4 = 6 * (3 + 1) is not directly applicable since 1 is not in our numbers, but directly: 4 * 6 = 24.\n\n## 7: Write down the final equation based on given numbers\nGiven the numbers 3, 4, 6, 6, a straightforward answer is 6 * 4 = 24.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6 * 4 =24}$"

But, 12 + 1 = 13 and 13 - 7 = 6, then 6 * 2 = 12, still not there. A direct approach seems elusive.\n\n## 4: Find the correct sequence of operations\nConsidering 12 as a base, if we can get 2, we have 12 * 2 = 24. Using 7 and 1, we get 7 - 1 = 6. Now, we have 2, 6, and 12. But we actually need to directly use the numbers given without adding extra steps. So, looking at it again: 7 - 2 = 5, and 5 * ? no. But (12 / ? ) * ? = 24. Since 12 * 2 = 24, let's get 2: 7 - 5 no, but 1 + 2 = 3, 3 * ? no. How about 12 / (7 - 1) = 12 / 6 = 2, then 2 * 12 = 24.\n\n## 5: Construct the solution\nThe steps could be:\n- 7 - 1 = 6 (left: 2, 6, 12)\n- 12 / 6 = 2 (left: 2, 2)\n- 2 * 2 = 4, no, we actually stop at 12 / 6 = 2, then 2 * 12.\n\n## 6: Write down the arithmetic expression\nThe expression becomes 12 * (7 - 1) / 2 = 24, but to follow the format strictly and use all numbers exactly once in a meaningful operation sequence: (7-1) = 6, then 12 / 6 = 2, and 2 * 12 = 24. So, 12 * (7 - 1) / 2 does not fit; correctly it is 12 / (7-1) * 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12 / (7 - 1) * 2 = 24}$"

Noticing the numbers, 13 - 11 = 2, 8 / 4 = 2, or 8 + 4 = 12, which is half of 24.\n\n## 3: Try to get 24 using the numbers\nIf we get 12, we can then try to get 2 to multiply by 12 to get 24. We have 11 - 8 = 3 and 13 - 4 = 9, but no direct 2. However, 8 - 4 = 4 and 13 - 11 = 2. So, (13 - 11) * (8 + 4) could work.\n\n## 4: Calculate using the promising operations\nLet's calculate: 8 + 4 = 12, and 13 - 11 = 2. Then, 12 * 2 = 24.\n\n## 5: Formulate the expression\nThe expression would be: (8 + 4) * (13 - 11) = 12 * 2 = 24.\n\n## 6: Verify the steps and formulate the answer\nSteps:\n1. 8 + 4 = 12 (left: 11, 13, 12)\n2. 13 - 11 = 2 (left: 2, 12)\n3. 12 * 2 = 24 (left: 24)\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(8 + 4) * (13 - 11) = 24}$"

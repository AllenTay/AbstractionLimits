            "## Step 1: Analyze the Given Numbers and Target\nWe are given the numbers 4, 8, 11, and 13, and we need to make 24 using each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.\n\n## 2: Explore Different Combinations and Operations\nLet's try to make 24 by combining these numbers in various ways. One approach is to try and get close to 24 or create factors of 24.\n\n## 3: Identify Potential Combinations\nNotice that \\(13 + 11 = 24\\), but this doesn't use 4 and 8. Let's try combining the numbers differently.\n\n## 4: Utilize All Numbers in a Single Expression\nConsider the expression: \\((13 - 11) * (8 + 4)\\).\nCalculating this: \\(13 - 11 = 2\\) and \\(8 + 4 = 12\\), then \\(2 * 12 = 24\\).\n\n## 5: Validate the Solution\nThe expression \\((13 - 11) * (8 + 4) = 2 * 12 = 24\\) uses all the given numbers exactly once and achieves the target of 24.\n\n## 6: Provide the Final Answer\nTherefore, the solution that meets the criteria is:\nAnswer: (13 - 11) * (8 + 4) = 24"

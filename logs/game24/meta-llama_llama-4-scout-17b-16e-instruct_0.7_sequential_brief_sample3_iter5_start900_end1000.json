We need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.\n\n## 2: Explore a combination that could work\nLet's try to combine the numbers to get close to or exactly 24. Consider the equation: \\[ 6 * 6 = 36 \\], which is too high. We need to reduce 36 to 24.\n\n## 3: Adjust the combination to fit\nTo get from 36 to 24, we could divide by 1.5. Let's see if we can make 1.5 using 2 and 5: \\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \\]. Then, \\[ 36 / (5 - 2) = 36 / 3 = 12 \\], still not there.\n\n## 4: Direct calculation with a promising combination\nConsider: \\[ 5 * 6 = 30 \\], to get to 24, we need to subtract 6. But we have two 6s and a 2. Let's try: \\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \\], then \\[ 5 * 6 / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5 \\], which does not work.\n\n## 5: Solution identification\nHowever, notice:\n\\[ 6 * (5 - 2) = 6 * 3 = 18 \\], still short. Let's add the other 6:\n\\[ 6 * (5 - 2) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \\].\n\n## 6: Verify the solution\nThe equation \\[ 6 * (5 - 2) + 6 = 24 \\] uses each number exactly once and equals 24.\n\nAnswer: 6 * (5 - 2) + 6 = 24"

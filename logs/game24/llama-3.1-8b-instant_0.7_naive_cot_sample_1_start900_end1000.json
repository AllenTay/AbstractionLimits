            "To obtain 24 using the given numbers 3, 3, 4, and 11, follow these steps:\n\n3 + 4 = 7 (left: 3 7)\n3 * 7 = 21 (left: 21)\n21 + 3 = 24 (left: 24)\n\nHowever, it seems more efficient to use the numbers in a different order. Follow these steps instead:\n\n11 - 3 = 8 (left: 3 8)\n8 - 3 = 5 (left: 5)\n5 + 3 = 8 (left: 8)\n8 + 3 = 11 (left: 11)\n11 + 3 = 14 (left: 14)\n14 + 3 = 17 (left: 17)\n17 + 3 = 20 (left: 20)\n20 + 3 = 23 (left: 23)\n23 + 1 (3) is not possible since we don't have 1 left. Thus, we must use the second method for 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3 + 4 = 7 (left: 3 7)\n7 + 3 = 10 (left: 10)\n10 + 3 = 13 (left: 13)\n13 + 3 = 16 (left: 16)\n16 + 3 = 19 (left: 19)\n19 + 3 = 22 (left: 22)\n22 + 3 = 25 (left: 25)\n\nHowever, we can use one of the given methods. Another method could be 4 * 3 * 2. However, we don't have 2, so we cannot use this. We can also use 11 - 3 = 8, then 8 - 3 = 5, and then 5 + 3 = 8, and 8 + 3 = 11. Another way could be to try multiplying the 3s which gives us 9, then 9 + 3 = 12, 12 + 3 = 15, 15 + 3 = 18, and 18 + 3 = 21, and 21 + 3 = 24.\n\nHowever, the most efficient method is to use the numbers 3, 3, 4, and 11 to get 24 as follows:\n\n11 - 3 = 8 (left: 3 8)\n8 - 3 = 5 (left: 5)\n5 + 3 = 8 (left: 8)\n8 + 3 = 11 (left: 11)\n11 - 3 = 8 (left: 8)\n8 + 3 = 11 (left: 11)\n3 + 3 = 6 (left: 6 11)\n6 * 11 = 66 (left: 66)\n66 - 11 = 55 (left: 55)\n55 - 11 = 44 (left: 44)\n44 - 11 = 33 (left: 33)\n33 - 11 = 22 (left: 22)\n22 - 11 = 11 (left: 11)\n11 - 3 = 8 (left: 8)\n8 - 3 = 5 (left: 5)\n5 + 3 = 8 (left: 8)\n8 + 3 = 11 (left: 11)\n5 * 11 = 55 (left: 55)\n55 - 11 = 44 (left: 44)\n44 - 11 = 33 (left: 33)\n33 - 11 = 22 (left: 22)\n22 - 11 = 11 (left: 11)\n11 - 8 = 3 (left: 3)\n3 + 3 = 6 (left: 6)\n6 * 11 = 66 (left: 66)\n66 - 22 = 44 (left: 44)\n44 - 22 = 22 (left: 22)\n22 - 11 = 11 (left: 11)\n11 - 11 = 0 (left: 0)\nThis path does not lead to the desired result of 24.\n\nHowever, the most efficient method is to use the numbers 3, 3, 4, and 11 to get 24 as follows:\n\n3 + 3 = 6 (left: 6 4 11)\n6 * 4 = 24 (left: 24)\nHowever, we cannot use this since we are not allowed to repeat the steps of using the same operation twice in a row."

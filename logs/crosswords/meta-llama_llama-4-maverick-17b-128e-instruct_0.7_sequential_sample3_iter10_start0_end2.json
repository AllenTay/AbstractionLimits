            "To solve the given 5x5 mini crossword, we need to fill in the answers according to the clues provided for both horizontal and vertical positions. Let's analyze the clues:\n\n### Horizontal Clues\n1. An agendum; something to be done\n2. An engine\n3. Pretentious; flowery\n4. A salon; a hall\n5. To mock; to sneer\n\n### Vertical Clues\n1. To heap\n2. An Indian antelope\n3. To intend; to plan; to devise; a nettle; to guess\n4. A nozzle\n5. Desiccator; more dry\n\nLet's start with the horizontal clues as they often provide a good starting point.\n\n1. **h1. An agendum; something to be done** - The answer is likely \"ITEMS\" because an item is something to be done or considered. However, we need a 5-letter word. A plausible 5-letter answer is \"TO-DO\" doesn't fit, but \"AMEND\" or simply \"ITEMS\" doesn't fit due to the 'S'. A good fit is \"TO-DOs\" isn't valid, so let's consider \"ERRAT\" isn't it, a good 5-letter fit is \"AMISS\" or \"TO-DO\" is not valid, a valid 5-letter answer is \"ITEMS\" is not valid due to the 'S', a good fit is \"AMEND\". Let's directly check: \"AMEND\" fits as it means to make changes or to correct.\n\n2. **h2. An engine** - A 5-letter word for \"an engine\" is \"MOTOR\".\n\n3. **h3. Pretentious; flowery** - For \"pretentious\" or \"flowery\", a 5-letter word is \"FLAIR\".\n\n4. **h4. A salon; a hall** - A 5-letter fit is \"SALON\".\n\n5."
